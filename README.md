##How to Play
In *E-Motional Escape* you are tasked with navigating a little emotional ball (E-Ball) around a labrinth to find the exit (currently, there are two levels plus a "test" level used during development). Depending on what you do, or don't do, the E-Ball's emotions will shift between **Aggression**, **Neediness**, and **Contentment**. Each emotional state has a different effect on the E-Ball and triggers different environmental obsticals. **Aggression** is easiest to build up, and allows you to push the E-Ball the furthest and fastest, at the loss of fine control. **Neediness** builds when the E-Ball is at rest and the mouse cursor is far away from the E-Ball... it enjoys the presence of the mouse cursor... and the E-Ball will move itself towards the mouse cursor (but not while in the air). **Contentment** is achieved when the E-Ball is calmed either by the mouse hovering over it for a time, or gentally keeping the E-Ball in the air, but the E-Ball will not move nearly as fast when content... perferring to take things slow.

You may need to keep an eye on the E-Ball's emotions, as different emotional states will open different doorways.

Furthermore, E-Ball can find some environmental help from the particle winds. However, the particle winds will only push the E-Ball if it's own particles closely match that of the winds. Thankfully, the E-Ball can find pools of colored liquids that can be used to match the E-Ball's particles to those of the winds... however, the liquids can also affect the emotional state of the corresponding color!!

All of this can be navigated with a single (left) mouse button (or, optionally, the "z" key on the keyboard). When held down, a green arrow will appear pointing away from the E-Ball in the opposite direction of the mouse. When the button is released, the E-Ball will be pushed in the direction of the arrow. The further the mouse is from the E-Ball when released, the stronger the push will be.
